# Goalkeeper Robot for RoboCup âš½ðŸ¤–  

Welcome to the **Goalkeeper Robot** project for **RoboCup**! This repository contains all the necessary resources for developing an **autonomous goalkeeper**, including firmware, hardware designs, simulations, and documentation.  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This robot is designed to detect, track, and block the ball in a RoboCup match using **computer vision, real-time control, and AI-based decision-making**. The project integrates **embedded systems, robotics, and simulation tools** to optimize performance.
